# DevTKSS.MyManufacturerERP

This repository is under development and is not yet ready for production use. It is intended to become a cross-platform ERP solution using Uno Platform to target web, desktop, and mobile platforms.

## The MyManufacturerERP solution

MyManufacturerERP is a comprehensive ERP solution designed for highly scalable manufacturing business need cases. It provides tools for managing production, inventory, sales, and accounting, all in one app, but on all platforms.

The initial target is to create this solution for my own manufacturing business, but it could get also a solution that can be used by other manufacturers as well.

## In Progress Features

- Web API integration
- Cross-platform target platform support (Web, Desktop, Mobile)
- Database support for In-Memory, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite (on the client)
- User authentication and authorization
- Support for multiple languages and cultures
- Integration of E-Commerce Marketplace API of e.g. Etsy as sales channel for manufacturers

## Getting Started

To get started with the MyManufacturerERP solution, follow these steps:

1. Install the latest version of Visual Studio with the Uno Platform extension, ASP.NET and web development workload.
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
1. Restore the NuGet packages.
1. (At some point in the future) Run the solution to see the initial setup.

## Roadmap

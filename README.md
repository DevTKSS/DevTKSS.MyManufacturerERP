# DevTKSS.MyManufacturerERP

This repository is under development and is not yet ready for production use. It is intended to become a cross-platform ERP solution using Uno Platform to target web, desktop, and mobile platforms.

## The MyManufacturerERP solution

MyManufacturerERP is a comprehensive ERP solution designed for highly scalable manufacturing business needcases. It provides tools for managing production, inventory, sales, and financials, all in one app, but on all platforms.

The initial target is to create this solution for my own manufacturing business, but it could get also a solution that can be used by other manufacturers as well.

## In Progress Features

- Web API integration
- Cross-platform target platform support (Web, Desktop, Mobile)
- Database support for In-Memory, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite (on the client)
- User authentication and authorization
- Support for multiple languages and cultures
- Integration of E-Commerce Marketplace API of e.g. Etsy as sales channel for manufacturers
